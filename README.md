# Google Drive Website Publisher

I developed this tool to make it easy to create a personal website or a website for a project or a collective based on Google Docs.

(Also an excuse to play with Deno)

## How to use

(work in progress)

1. Create a folder with the name of your website (e.g. xavierdamman.com)
1. Create a Google Doc name "index" to represent your homepage
1. Share it with website@citizenspring.earth
1. Enjoy it on https://citizenspring.earth/xavierdamman.com
